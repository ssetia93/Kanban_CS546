# Kanban_CS546
Final project for CS546, Fall 2016
Introduction
We want to build a web application similar to a Kanban Board. Users can have different tasks in different lists which they can prioritize, maintain and update as and when they want. It’ll be a much simpler version of the Kanban board, which almost every student, or for that matter every person uses to simplify their everyday life.
Proposal
A Kanban board web application.
Features of the System
Core:
1. Create profile 2. Login 3. Manage profile 4. Create task and assign it to one of the 4 different lists: a. Backup (Listing all the tasks that need to be done)
b. To do (Listing tasks to be done today or in the next few days) c. Doing (Tasks in progress; must not be more than 5) d. Done (Completed tasks)
5. Prioritizing tasks by the user according to what suits him. 6. View the tasks in a calendar based on it’s due date.7. Reminder emails to users for tasks nearing the due date. 8. Congratulatory emails to users when they complete all tasks in the list.
 Extra:
1 Use cloud services to backup the user tasks. 2 Users can invite their friends to use this app by sending invites. 3 Let the user form groups with other users. This way they can have a group with the same set of tasks, with each task assigned to a user that belongs to the
group.
